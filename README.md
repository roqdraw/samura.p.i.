# SAMURA.P.I. (The Still-Updating Updated Version!)

View it here : https://samurapi.herokuapp.com/.

## About
SamurA.P.I. is an app for all those who are interested in the way of the samurai and can learn more about the philosophy about the great Japanese warriors. This little turf on the internet provides information about 'Bushido', the philosophy and the code of conduct the samurai devoted themselves to uphold in their lives and to share various media where people can discover more about this code, making the audience demographic a niche but fiercely curious about philosophy.

## Project Narrative

### Note:
This project is an extension of my [previous one](https://roqdraw.github.io/samura.p.i/).
Days 1 - 4 were the building blocks of the idea.

### Prototype Timeline
#### Day 1 & Day 2
The initial idea was to create a horizontally scrolling website that was inspired by this [website](http://exponius.sutueatsflies.com/).
It would have various characters popping up as the user scrolled to the right, having a story unfold.

As time was rnning out, it would've been easier to use a theme that has been established before instead of creating a wholly unique story with character art in under a week. A favourite interest of mine is bushido, the code of samurai whose principles are still being practiced today for a better holistic and well-strategised life.

Due to the time-limit and personal inexperience with coding, the breadth of the project became too ambitious so I had to switch to a vertical scrolling website in order to meet the due date. 

#### Day 3 & Day 4
Started from scratch with the bushido theme intact, knowing that with my time has been cut in half this website was going to be front-end heavy - a great constraint for meto work with so I could practice client-side methods. A rapid search for libraries and manipulating css was implemented in the project with a late addition of using API's to utilize some of my learnings throughout my coding course.

### Post-Prototype (Now.) 
The main reason why I decided to extend this idea was to practice and apply the knowledge I have learnt from General Assembly and practice more with creating CRUD apps, making a big app using Rails and deploying to Heroku. It's all a matter of practice and muscle memory althoiught this project is still being updated as I aim to make this a substantial app.

#### API's
1. The Movie DataBase - Acquiring film and tv data.
2. Google Books - Acquiring book data.

## Obstacles
1. Reusing assests and libraries from prototype and implementing them in the correct files.
2. Translating knowledge of Sinatra framework and applying them in Rails.
3. Learning Rails' behemoth conventions.

## Further Objectives
1. Make the website as a functional CRUD app.
2. Replace stock images with original artworks.
3. Add an overflowing scrolling div in each tenet page.
4. Have more interactivity in the Media section.
5. Users should click on a media image and more information comes up.
